Q 14.   (Airplane Seating Assignment) Write a program that can be used to
        assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with six
        seats in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 through 7 are business
        class, and rows 8 through 13 are economy class. Your program must prompt
        the user to enter the following information:
        a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
        b. Desired seat

                    A       B       C       D       E       F

        Row 1  :    X       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 2  :    *       X       *       *       *       *    

        Row 3  :    *       *       *       *       *       X    

        Row 4  :    *       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 5  :    *       *       X       *       *       *    

        Row 6  :    *       *       *       *       X       *    

        Row 7  :    *       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 8  :    *       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 9  :    *       X       *       *       *       *    

        Row 10 :    *       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 11 :    *       *       *       *       *       *    

        Row 12 :    *       *       *       *       X       *    

        Row 13 :    *       *       *       *       *       * 

        Here, * indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat is
        occupied. Make this a menu-driven program; show the userâ€™s choices and
        allow the user to make the appropriate choices.
